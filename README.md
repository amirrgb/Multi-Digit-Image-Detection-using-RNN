# Multi-Digit Image Detection using RNN

This project focuses on detecting and recognizing multi-digit numbers from vehicle plate images using deep learning techniques. The model utilizes **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** to learn digit sequences from image data, based on the **CAR-A** and **CAR-B** datasets.

## Features

* Processes vehicle plate images and extracts digit labels.
* Uses TensorFlow/Keras for model training.
* Supports both training and testing datasets.
* Designed for multi-digit number recognition tasks.

## Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PIL
